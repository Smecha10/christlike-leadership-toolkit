        <div class="principle-card active" id="principle1">
            <h2>PRINCIPLE 1: SERVE FIRST, LEAD SECOND</h2>
            
            <h3>Core Concept</h3>
            <p>True leadership begins with genuine service to others. Leaders who prioritize the growth and well-being of their team members build trust, loyalty, and sustainable performance. This approach shifts the focus from positional authority to relational influence.</p>
            
            <h3>Research Foundation</h3>
            <p>Servant leadership theory (Greenleaf, 1970) demonstrates that leaders who serve first create psychologically safe environments where team members feel valued, heard, and empowered to contribute their best work. Organizations with servant leaders report higher employee engagement, lower turnover, and stronger innovation.</p>
            
            <h3>Practical Applications</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Ask "How can I help you succeed?" in one-on-one meetings</li>
                <li>Remove obstacles that prevent team members from doing their best work</li>
                <li>Celebrate team successes publicly while addressing failures privately</li>
                <li>Invest time in understanding individual career goals and development needs</li>
                <li>Make decisions that prioritize long-term team health over short-term personal gains</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="activity-box">
                <h3>Workshop Activity</h3>
                <p>Pair participants and have them identify one specific obstacle each person faces in their role. Partners then brainstorm three concrete actions a leader could take to remove that obstacle. Debrief by discussing what it feels like to be served versus managed.</p>

            <h2>PRINCIPLE 2: SEE INDIVIDUALS, NOT JUST OUTCOMES</h2>
            
            <h3>Core Concept</h3>
            <p>Effective leaders recognize that sustainable results come from valuing people as whole individuals rather than treating them as means to an end. This principle emphasizes the importance of seeing each team member's unique strengths, challenges, and potential.</p>
            
            <h3>Research Foundation</h3>
            <p>Humanistic management research shows that when leaders demonstrate genuine interest in individuals, trust increases and performance improves. Studies on psychological safety confirm that people perform better when they feel seen, known, and valued beyond their productivity metrics.</p>
            
            <h3>Practical Applications</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Learn and remember personal details about team members (family, interests, goals)</li>
                <li>Check in on well-being before discussing task updates</li>
                <li>Adjust leadership style to fit individual needs rather than applying one-size-fits-all approaches</li>

            <p>Humble leaders create environments where learning, innovation, and honest feedback thrive. Humility in leadership means acknowledging limitations, valuing diverse perspectives, and prioritizing team success over personal credit.</p>
            
            <h3>Research Foundation</h3>
            <p>Research on Level 5 Leadership suggests that the most effective leaders combine personal humility with strong professional will. Humble leaders build cultures where mistakes become learning opportunities instead of threats.</p>

            <h3>Core Concept</h3>
            <p>Great leaders multiply their impact by empowering others to act with autonomy and accountability. Trust-based leadership means giving people meaningful responsibility, supporting their decisions, and allowing space for growth through experience.</p>
            
            <h3>Research Foundation</h3>
            <p>Self-Determination Theory highlights autonomy as a core human need. When leaders trust people with real authority, intrinsic motivation rises, creativity flourishes, and ownership deepens, while micromanagement undermines engagement.</p>

            <h3>Core Concept</h3>
            <p>Trust is built when leaders consistently align their actions with their stated values. Integrity means doing what is right even when it is costly, and consistency means people can predict how you will respond in various situations.</p>
            
            <h3>Research Foundation</h3>
            <p>Organizational trust research shows that perceived leader integrity is a strong predictor of follower trust. When leaders demonstrate consistent values-based behavior, team members feel safe, morale improves, and ethical culture strengthens.</p>
